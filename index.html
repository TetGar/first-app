        <strong><em>"Cycling</em></strong> is a low impact type of aerobic
        activity that can benefit a person‚Äôs health and fitness. It is a useful
        exercise that many people can incorporate into their daily lives as a
        mode of transport, casual activity, or competitive sport. As it is
        relatively easy to start and suitable for most fitness levels, it is a
        popular physical activity.<br />Cycling is also a suitable activity for
        most people and one that many individuals can add to their daily
        routine. People can also take safety precautions to make cycling safer,
        such as wearing safety gear, choosing a suitable bicycle, and cycling in
        areas with less air pollution. "
